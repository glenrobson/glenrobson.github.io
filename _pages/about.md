I currently work as the [IIIF Technical Coordinator][IIIF-tech] for the IIIF consortium assisting institutions in implementing IIIF and also supporting the technical infrastructure for IIIF.

Before working for IIIF I spent 12 years at the [National Library of Wales][NLW] starting as a developer on their [Fedora repository][fcrepo] and ending as Head of Systems where I managed a team who supported their digital repository, cataloguing systems and IIIF implementation.

I hope to use this blog to share answers to questions I get asked as the Technical Coordinator and also to share some personal experiences.
